### Extend This Bot

This bot is built on top of the starter pack of [bot-kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) for [Cisco Spark](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme-ciscospark.md)

All the actions this bot can perform are in `skills/` folder. The main bot application will automatically include any files placed there.

A skill module should be in the format:
```
module.exports = function(controller) {
    // add event handlers to controller
}
```
