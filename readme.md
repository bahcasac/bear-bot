### Extend This Bot

This bot is built on top of the starter pack of [bot-kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) for [Cisco Spark](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme-ciscospark.md)

All the actions this bot can perform are in `skills/` folder. The main bot application will automatically include any files placed there.

A skill module should be in the format:

```
module.exports = function(controller) {

    // add event handlers to controller
    // such as hears handlers that match triggers defined in code
    // or controller.studio.before, validate, and after which tie into triggers
    // defined in the Botkit Studio UI.

}
```
